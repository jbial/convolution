This notebook is a deep dive on the topic of convolution.

Why? To master the fundamentals. Plus, I think it's fun to go in-depth on conceptually simple topics.

Lot's of LaTeX in this one. Github still wont render the equations properly in the browser, so please feel free to clone and run `jupyter-notebook convolution.ipynb`.
