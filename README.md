This notebook is a deep dive on the topic of convolution.

Why? To master the fundamentals. Plus, I think it's fun to go in-depth on conceptually simple topics.

#### Usage
Lots of LaTeX in this one.

Github still won't render the equations properly in the browser, so please feel free to:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jbial/convolution
$ cd convolution
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ jupyter-notebook convolution.ipynb
```
